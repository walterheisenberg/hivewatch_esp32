# hivewatch_esp32

This is the my Micropython implementaion to push sensor data to [Thingspeak](https://thingspeak.com/) and [Hiveeyes](https://hiveeyes.org/)

Sensors:
* HX711 for the scale
* DHT22 for temperature and humidity

I don't need any broodsensors or microphones inside the beehive. If anyone wants to add it, please
feel free to do so.

It is my beginning to code in python, so please excuse weird code ;)
Improvements and tipps are welcome!
